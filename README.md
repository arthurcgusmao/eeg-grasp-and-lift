# EEG Grasp and Lift

This project contains implementation of a convolutional neural network model used to tackle [a Kaggle competition on EEG recordings](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grasp-and-lift-eeg-detection), used as my final project for the Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree course.

For a detailed report about the project's definition, data analysis, methodology, results and conclusions, please refer to the [`capstone_report.md`](./capstone_report.md) file.
